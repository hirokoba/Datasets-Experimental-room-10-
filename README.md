# Datasets-Experimental-room-10-

This is a data set created for learning spatial concept.  
This dataset includes the position on the map, the orientation on the map, and the images taken there.  
The position on the map is the self position of the robot estimated by MCL.  
Data was taken at experimental room 10 of Emergent Systems Laboratory at Ritsumeikan University.  
Experimental room 10 is the home environment.  
The dataset is divided into four because the file size is too large.  

# Details

・The number of data : 1075  
・/particle : This is the coordinates and orientation of all particles sampled by the MCL when the robot estimates position information.(x,y,sin,cos)  
・/position_data : It is Two dimensional coordinates and orientation estimated by MCL.(x,y,sin,cos)  
・/sample_image : jpg image.
